Hi, I'm Gunjan—a passionate student and aspiring web developer specializing in HTML and CSS. I thrive on creativity and have a relentless curiosity that pushes me to explore new horizons. Whether I’m building something from scratch or polishing up a project, I always pour my energy into learning and creating.

Project highlight: Campus Shelf—a modern library app designed to make campus resources more accessible and engaging for students.

I believe in learning by doing. Once I grasp 70-80% of a skill, I’m ready to dive into the next challenge, constantly expanding my toolkit and perspective.

Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
